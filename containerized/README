As a multi-component system, NGS pipeline setup is traditionally heavy on 
configuration. Our idea is to provide this in a simple encapsulated container. 
Users also typically wish to configure their own environments and run the 
pipeline on a wide range of hardware (workstations to clusters to cloud), being 
able to stand-up a pipeline with minimal fuss is made straightforward with this 
container.

- The Dockerfiles for building this pipeline:

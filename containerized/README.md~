NGSeasy v1.0
===================

[Dockerized](https://www.docker.com/) and [Virtulaized](https://www.virtualbox.org/) ngs pipeline and tool-box.  

As a multi-component system, NGS pipeline setup is traditionally heavy on 
configuration. Our idea is to provide this in a simple encapsulated container. 
Users also typically wish to configure their own environments and run the 
pipeline on a wide range of hardware (workstations to clusters to cloud), being 
able to stand-up a pipeline with minimal fuss is made straightforward with this 
container.  

**With NGSeasy you can now have full suite of NGS tools up and running on any high end workstation in an afternoon**

Dockerised NGSEASY
==========================
![docker](figs/Docker_container_engine_logo.png "Docker")  

## Installing Docker

Follow the simple instructions in the links provided below  

- [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/)  
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/)
- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/)

A full set of instructions for multiple operating systems are available on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).

## Getting the Dockerised NGSEASY Pipeline

Available NGSeasy images at [afolarin/ Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/afolarin/) and [snewhouse/ Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/snewhouse/)

#### Getting the main NGSeasy suite of tools

[snewhouse/ngseasy-alignment-public:v1.2](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/snewhouse/ngseasy-alignment-public/)

This is a large image (4.989 GB) containing all the tools needed to go from raw ``.fastq`` files to aligned ``.BAM`` to SNP and small INDEL variant calls ``.vcf`` .

```bash
sudo docker pull snewhouse/ngseasy-alignment-public:v1.2
```

#### Getting All NGSeasy images

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# get ngseasy from DockerHub
repo='snewhouse'

for i in alignment-public:v1.2 \
fastqc:v1.0 \
var-callers:v1.1 \
var-anno:v1.1 \
sv-delly:v1.1 \
sv-lumpy:v1.1 \
sv-mhmm:v1.0 \
sv-cnmops:v1.0 \
sv-exomedepth:v1.0 \
bedtools:v1.0 \
bwa:v1.0 \
bowtie2:v1.0 \
gatk:v1.0 \
picard:v1.0 \
samtools:v1.0 \
stampy:v1.0 \
vcftools:v1.0 \
freebayes:v1.0 \
platypus:v1.0;do
sudo docker pull ${repo}/ngseasy-${i};
done
```

## Running the Dockerised NGSEASY Pipeline

```bash
sudo docker run -d -P \
-v ~/fastq_raw:~/fastq_raw \
-v ~/reference_geneomes:~/reference_genomes \
-v ~/gatk_resources:~/gatk_resources \
-v ~/ngs_projects:~/ngs_projects \
-u pipeman \
-t snewhouse/alignment-public:v1.2 /sbin/my_init -- bash run-ea-ngs.sh ngs.config
```

``-v`` used to mount host directories containing fastq, reference genomes, gatk resources and project output.
The ``-u pipeman`` ensures it is run using the ``pipeman`` user.

## Local Machine Set up

### Download NGSeasy resources 

This is a XXGB ``ngseasy_resources.tar.gz`` file containing :-  

- reference genomes indexed for use with all provided aligners
- annotation bed files for use with pipeline scripts
- ANNOVAR humandb 
- gatk resources bundle
- Example 75bp PE Illumina Whole Exome Sequence fastq data for **NA12878**

```bash
tar ngseasy_resources.tar.gz
```

**On your local machine, ensure the following directories exist:-**

- ``fastq_raw`` [to hold all incoming raw fastq files]
- ``ngs_projects`` [out put directory for all ngs projects]
- ``reference_genomes`` [get from URL and unpack. NB: XXX GB!]
- ``gatk_resources`` [vcf and annotation files used by GATK]
- ``humandb`` [annovar databases]

These folders are required by pipeline as they are hardcoded in the NGSeasy scripts. I would recommend installing these in your ``HOME`` directory.

### Getting the GATK Resources Bundle for yourself

[What's in the resource bundle and how can I get it?](https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article.php?id=1213)

```bash
## FTP Login Details
location: ftp.broadinstitute.org
username: gsapubftp-anonymous
password: <blank>
```
I would recommend using a separate program like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), which will make it much easier for you to set up and manage your file transfers

**Path to gatk_resources.tgz**
```
ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/distribution/gsa/gatk_resources.tgz
```

### From GATK Web
**b37 Resources: the Standard Data Set**
- Reference sequence (standard 1000 Genomes fasta) along with fai and dict files  
- dbSNP in VCF. This includes two files:  
-- The most recent dbSNP release  
This file subsetted to only sites discovered in or before dbSNPBuildID 129, which excludes the impact of the 1000 Genomes project and is useful for evaluation of dbSNP rate and Ti/Tv values at novel sites.
- HapMap genotypes and sites VCFs
- OMNI 2.5 genotypes for 1000 Genomes samples, as well as sites, VCF
- The current best set of known indels to be used for local realignment (note that we don't use dbSNP for this anymore); use both files:
- 1000G_phase1.indels.b37.vcf (currently from the 1000 Genomes Phase I indel calls)
- Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.sites.vcf
- A large-scale standard single sample BAM file for testing:
- NA12878.HiSeq.WGS.bwa.cleaned.recal.hg19.20.bam containing ~64x reads of NA12878 on chromosome 20
- The results of the latest UnifiedGenotyper with default arguments run on this data set (NA12878.HiSeq.WGS.bwa.cleaned.recal.hg19.20.vcf)  

Additionally, these files all have supplementary indices, statistics, and other QC data available.

NGSEASY-VM : An NGS Tool Box
================================
![VirtualBox](figs/add-virtualbox.png "VirtualBox")  

A virtual machine based on [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop), containing all these [NGS Tools](https://github.com/KHP-Informatics/ngs/blob/dev/containerized/README.md#the-tools-included-are-as-follows--) (and a few extras) is available. The virtual machine contains indexed reference genomes (b37) for all the installed aligners and the [GATK Resources Budle](https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download).  

Using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and our NGSEASY-VM you can have a full suite of NGS tools up and running on any high end workstation in less than an hour.

## 1. Installing Oracle VirtualBox

The latest Oracle VM VirtualBox is available [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html#vbox)

Remember to install the latest [Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html#extpack)

A full set of instructions are available here:-  

- [Oracle VirtualBox](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html)  
- [VirtualBox User Manual](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/UserManual.pdf)  
- [VirtualBox Installation Details](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html)  


## 2. Getting the ngseasy-vm

Download the ngseasy-vm [ngseasy-vm.vdi]() and save this anywhere on your local machine.  

**NOTE:** This file is XXXGB in size.  

## 3. Installing the ngseasy-vm

Create a new virtual machine from the downloaded [ngseasy-vm.vdi]().  

**Step 1.** Fire up VirtualBox and click **New**  
**Step 2.** The **Create Virtual Machine** window will appear  
**Step 3.** You will presented with 3 options that need to be set as  

> Name: **ngseasy**  
> Type: **Linux**  
> Version: **Ubuntu (64 bit)** 
 
**Step 4.** Click **Next** . This will take you to the **Memory Size** window  
**Step 5.** Select the amount of memmory (RAM) in megabytes to be allocated to the virtual machine (recommended 8GB). The size you 
allocate will depend on the available RAM on your machine. Adjust this vaule as needed. Click **Next**  
**Step 6.** This will take you to the **Hard drive** window. This is the important step. You will be presented with 3 options:-  

> Do not add a virtual hard drive  
> Create a virtual hard drive  
> Use an existing virtual hard drive file  

**Step 7.** Select **Use an existing virtual hard drive file**.   
**Step 8.** Click on the folder icon and point to the **ngseasy-vm.vdi** file.  
**Step 9.** Step  Click **Create**  

Once the new virtual machine is created, that virtual machine should fire up as expected 
and regardless of platform (I have tested this going from Linux to Linux, Linux to Windows, and Windows to Linux hosts).  

Before starting the virtual machine you can go to the **Settings** tab and alter the amount or RAM, CPUs assigned to the machine.
There is also the functionality to mount shared drives between the host OS and the virtual machine. In the **General** > **Advanced** tab,
ensure thet the **Shared Clipboard** and **Drang n Drop** are both set to **Bidirectional**.
